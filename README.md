## Project Name: Recipes 

On this project I built a simple recipe website that contains a home page, and three linked recipe pages with images. 

While working on the project, I utilized the skills gained up to this point as follows:

    1. Using basic command lines such as: 
        - cd
        - pwd
        - mkdir
        - touch
        - mv
        - ls
        - code . 
        - open [file]

    2. Practicing basic Git workflow such as: 
        - Create a repository on GitHub 
        - Connect the repository to my local computer
        - Add and commit 

    3. Using Basic Git commands such as:
        - git clone
        - git add
        - git commit -m ""
        - git push origin main 
        - git status
        - git log

    4. Understanding HTML Foundation such as:
        - Basic HTML boilerplate 
        - Create paragraphs, headings, unordered/ordered lists, relative links
        - Add images with alt attribute

    5. Writing Significant commit messages
        
    6. Using Visual Code Studio as text editor
